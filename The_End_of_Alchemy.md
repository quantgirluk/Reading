# The End of Alchemy: Money, Banking and the Future of the Global 
<a name="top"></a>

This book written by [Mervin King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mervyn_King,_Baron_King_of_Lothbury), British economist and public servant who served as the Governor of the Bank of England from 2003 to 2013. In his own words it tells you “everything you need to know but were afraid to ask about the causes of the recent crisis. So here goes.”


The book opens with a reference to this fragment from "A Tale of Two Cities" from Charles Dickens.

“It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,
it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness,
it was the epoch of belief,
it was the epoch of incredulity,
it was the season of Light,
it was the season of Darkness,
it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair,
we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way— in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.”

## Introduction 

“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity …’
Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities”


“How did this happen? Was it a failure of individuals, institutions or ideas”


“Since the crisis, many have been tempted to play the game of deciding who was to blame for such a disastrous outcome. But blaming individuals is counterproductive – it leads you to think that if just a few, or indeed many, of those people were punished then we would never experience a crisis again.”



“There was a general misunderstanding of how the world economy worked”


“is it too late to put the genie back in the bottle? No – it is never too late to ask the right questions”


“one of the arguments of this book is that economics has encouraged ways of thinking that made crises more probable”



“Economists have brought the problem upon themselves by pretending that they can forecast. No one can easily predict an unknowable future, and economists are no exception.”


“A theory adequate for today requires us to think for ourselves, standing on the shoulders of giants of the past, not kneeling in front of them.”



“God may have created the universe, but we mortals created paper money and risky banks. They are man-made institutions, important sources of innovation, prosperity and material progress, but also of greed, corruption and crises. For better or worse, they materially affect human welfare.”



“money and banking have been seen as the magical elements that liberated us from a stagnant feudal system and permitted the emergence of dynamic markets capable of making the long-term investments necessary to support a growing economy.”



“banks could take secure short-term deposits and transform them into long-term risky investments, came into its own with the Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth century. It was both revolutionary and immensely seductive. It was in fact financial alchemy – the creation of extraordinary financial powers that defy reality and common sense.”



“slow growth and rising unemployment – the combination known as ‘stagflation”



“Is there a fundamental weakness in the intellectual economic framework underpinning contemporary thinking? Of course, economists use mathematical and statistical methods to understand a complex world – they would be remiss if they did not. Economics is an intellectual discipline that requires propositions to be not merely plausible but subject to the rigour of a logical proof.”



“By alchemy I mean the belief that all paper money can be turned into an intrinsically valuable commodity, such as gold, on demand and that money kept in banks can be taken out whenever depositors ask for it.”



“Four concepts are used extensively in the book: disequilibrium, radical uncertainty, the prisoner’s dilemma and trust.”


“Radical uncertainty refers to uncertainty so profound that it is impossible to represent the future in terms of a knowable and exhaustive list of outcomes to which we can attach probabilities”



“Almost all the things that define modern life, and which we now take for granted, such as cars, aeroplanes, computers and antibiotics, were once unimaginable. The essential challenge facing everyone living in a capitalist economy is the inability to conceive of what the future may hold.”



“Trust is the ingredient that makes a market economy work”



“Long ago, Confucius emphasised the crucial role of trust in the authorities: ‘Three things are necessary for government: weapons, food and trust. If a ruler cannot hold on to all three, he should give up weapons first and food next. Trust should be guarded to the end: without trust we cannot stand.’5”



“It seems that our market economy today is not providing an effective link between the present and the future.”



“Crises do not come out of thin air but are the result of the unavoidable mistakes made by people struggling to cope with an unknowable future”



“the Bank of England, the oldest continuously functioning central bank in the world”



“That certainly gave me a chance to see how money could be managed. I learned, and argued publicly, that this is done best not by relying on gifted individuals to weave their magic, but by designing and building institutions that can be run by people who are merely professionally competent.”

## Chapter 1 



“I think that Capitalism, wisely managed, can probably be made more efficient for attaining economic ends than any alternative system yet in sight.’
John Maynard Keynes, The End of Laissez-faire (1926)”



“History is what happened before you were born. That is why it is so hard to learn lessons from history: the mistakes were made by the previous generation.”



“A younger generation, in academia and government, trained in modern economics, would ensure that the Great Depression of the 1930s would never be repeated.”



“The financial crisis of 2007–9 (hereafter ‘the crisis’) was not the fault of particular individuals or economic policies. Rather, it was merely the latest manifestation of our collective failure to manage the relationship between finance – the structure of money and banking – and a capitalist system”



“Over many years, a capitalist economy has proved the most successful route to escape poverty and achieve prosperity”


Capitalism Definition:
“is an economic system in which private owners of capital hire wage-earners to work in their businesses and pay for investment by raising finance from banks and financial markets”


The Good, the Bad and the Ugly

“Good was a period between about 1990 and 2007 of unprecedented stability of both output and inflation”
“The Bad was the rise in debt levels”
“Between 1986 and 2006, household debt rose from just under 70 per cent of total household income to almost 120 per cent in the United States and from 90 per cent to around 140 per cent in the United Kingdom.9”
“The Ugly was the development of an extremely fragile banking system.”
“Trading of new and highly complex financial products among banks meant that they became so closely interconnected that a problem in one would spread rapidly to others, magnifying rather than spreading risk”
“Banks relied less and less on their own resources to finance lending and became more and more dependent on borrowing”


**NOTE:**
“With a leverage ratio of even 25 it would take a fall of only 4 per cent in the average value of a bank’s assets to wipe out the whole of the shareholders’ equity and leave it unable to service its debts.”

Why?



“In China alone, over 70 million manufacturing jobs were created during the twenty-first century, far exceeding the 42 million working in manufacturing in 2012 in the United States and Europe combined.17”


“Its share in world exports rose from 2 per cent to 12 per cent between 1990 and 2013.18 China and other Asian economies ran large trade surpluses. In other words, they were producing more than they were spending and saving more than they were investing at home.”


“The total assets of US banks, which for a long time had been around one-quarter of annual gross domestic product (GDP, the total value of goods and services produced in the economy), amounted to close to 100 per cent of GDP by the time of the crisis. In Britain, as the main financial centre in Europe, bank assets exceeded 500 per cent of GDP, and they were even larger in Ireland, Switzerland and Iceland.”


“There seemed no limit to China’s willingness to accumulate US dollars. And that has continued unabated – by the end of 2014, China’s foreign exchange reserves exceeded $4 trillion”



“It is always surprising how many bricks can be piled one on top of another without their collapsing. This truth is embodied in the first law of financial crises: an unsustainable position can continue for far longer than you would believe possible.29”


“Attention was focused on risky, irresponsible – and even illegal – mortgage lending in the United States. But the underlying financial problem was the vulnerability of the banking system to US sub-prime mortgages – loans to households on low incomes who were highly likely to default.”


“In 2007 the bank regulators were asked whether the US sub-prime mortgage market was sufficiently large to bring down major banks. The answer was an emphatic no. Although the stock of such mortgages was around $1 trillion, potential losses were not large enough to create a problem for the system as a whole. After all, the loss of wealth in the dotcom crash earlier in the decade had been eight times greater.”


**The Crisis**

“15 September the long-established investment bank Lehman Brothers failed –”


“Banks around the world found it impossible to finance themselves because no one knew which banks were safe and which weren’t. It was the biggest global financial crisis in history.”


“In early October 2008, two UK banks – Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBoS) – found themselves unable to get to the end of the day. The Bank of England lent £60 billion to the two banks to avoid a collapse of the banking system.31”



“The Great Panic lasted less than a month from the failure of Lehman Brothers to the announcement of the recapitalisation of the banks – twenty-eight days that shook the world”



“When the western banking system teetered on the verge of collapse, only drastic intervention, including partial nationalisation, saved it from going over the edge. The potential catastrophe of a collapse finally provoked action to recapitalise the banking system, using public money if necessary; the UK was first to respond, followed by the United States and then continental Europe. That action ended the bank run. The problem was that governments ended up guaranteeing all private creditors of the banks, imposing on future taxpayers a burden of unknown magnitude.”



“The alchemy of our present system of money and banking continues. The strange thing is that after arguably the biggest financial crisis in history, nothing much has really changed in terms either of the fundamental structure of banking or the reliance on central banks to restore macroeconomic prosperity.”



“Interest rates today are too high to permit rapid growth of demand in the short run, but too low to be consistent with a proper balance between spending and saving in the long run.”


“Money and banking proved to be not a form of alchemy, but the Achilles heel of capitalism – a point of weakness that threatens havoc on a scale that drains the life out of a capitalist economy”

## Chapter 2 


“The love of money is the root of all evil.’
1 Timothy, 6:10 (King James Bible)
‘Evil is the root of all money.’
Kiyotaki and Moore (2002)”



“In the United States I studied at Harvard as a Kennedy Scholar.1 Later in life, I was a member of the interviewing panel to select new scholars. One young man, who was studying theology at Oxford, entered the room and, obviously a little nervous, sat on the chair in front of a line of eminent figures. The chairman, a distinguished philosopher, started by asking, ‘Tell me, does God have much of a role in theology these days?’ The young man blinked and never recovered. But it made me think that the question one should ask of economists is, ‘Does money have much of a role in economics these days?”



“After the Normans conquered Britain in 1066, they put together an inventory of wealth – houses, cattle and agricultural land – in order to assess the taxable capacity of their new domain. Known as the Domesday Book, the survey (now available online) measured wealth in terms of pounds, shillings and pence, Anglo-Saxon monetary units still in use in my youth before the decimalisation of Britain’s currency in 1971”


“The earliest banknotes appeared in China in the seventh century AD. Later banknotes from the Ming dynasty in China were made from the bark of mulberry trees – the paper is still soft to the touch today.11 The penalty for counterfeiting was death – as advertised on the notes themselves.12”



“the paradox of money is that people choose to own something that has no intrinsic value, and pays no interest”



“Over time people chose to hold less of it, and money today largely comprises bank deposits rather than notes and coin. How did the liabilities of banks come to be used as money? To explain this we need an alternative history of money, one that focuses on the role of money as a store of value.”
“From this practice emerged the system of banking we see today – illiquid assets financed by liquid deposits or banknotes.”



“The problem with private banks’ creation of money is obvious. Money in the form of private banknotes and deposits is a claim on illiquid assets with an uncertain value. So both its acceptability and stability can from time to time come under threat.”



“After the Great Depression, the introduction of deposit insurance, with the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 1933, largely eliminated the risk to ordinary depositors. By transferring the risks to the taxpayer, deposit insurance reduced the likelihood of depositors running on their banks, but it cemented the role of banks as the main creators of money in the form of bank deposits with banknotes issued solely by government.”


“Over the past century, the amount of money in the US economy – defined broadly – has remained roughly stable as a proportion of GDP, at around two-thirds, and the share of bank deposits in total money has also been roughly constant at around 90 per cent.” “Gold and silver, which a hundred years ago amounted to around 10 per cent of total money and were of equal importance to notes and coin, are no longer counted as money.”


“Credit booms are less the result of irresponsible lending by banks and more the outcome of optimism on the part of borrowers, aided and abetted by low interest rates and competition between banks to meet customers’ demands.23”


“But the amount of money created by a private banking system may not always correspond to the amount that is socially desirable. Indeed, where the former exceeds the latter there is a risk of financial excess and inflation, and where the former falls short of the latter there is a risk of a financial crisis. Should money be created privately or publicly? The answer depends on how the choice affects the twin criteria of acceptability and stability.”



**Hypterinflation**
“hyperinflation’ – which is usually defined as a period in which the monthly rate of inflation goes above 50 per cent. That may not sound so bad, but it is equivalent to an annual rate of inflation of well over 1000 per cent” “Perhaps the simplest definition of a hyperinflation is when it becomes impossible to keep track of the inflation rate” “It is easier to measure such hyperinflations by the length of time it takes for prices to double”



**Gold**

“For most of the nineteenth century, and right up until the early 1930s, the price of gold was fixed at $20.65 per ounce.35 The Great Depression saw a revaluation of gold to around $35 an ounce, where it stayed until 1971, when the United States abandoned the policy of a fixed dollar price of gold”

“The price of gold is not only volatile but highly sensitive to changes in sentiment about the ability of governments to control their monetary system.”

“Arguably the largest hole in the ground anywhere in the world is the Super Pit at Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. After around fifteen years, the diggers in Kalgoorlie have created a hole that is 4.5 kilometres in length, 1.2 kilometres wide and 500 metres deep. Excavating this hole has yielded 27 million cubic metres of earth which, after processing with acid, has yielded just 10 cubic metres of gold.37”


“For centuries gold has been the most widely accepted form of payment. It is independent of government, and, ironically, governments themselves want to hold reserves in gold because they do not trust other countries to maintain the real value of claims denominated in their own paper currency”


“By far the largest holders of gold are the United States (over 8000 tonnes, comprising 72 per cent of its total reserves of gold and foreign exchange) and the euro area (10,784 tonnes, accounting for 57 per cent of total reserves). China’s holdings have been rising and are now over 1000 tonnes. By contrast, the United Kingdom has only 310 tonnes (11.6 per cent of total reserves) and Japan 765 tonnes (2.5 per cent of total reserves).43”




“If one is very clever, it is indeed possible to talk about monetary policy without using the word ‘money’. The interesting question is why anyone would want to”


“More generally, our inability to make credible pre-commitments, or to trust each other, explains why ‘evil is the root of all money’, to use the phrase coined by the economists Nobuhiro Kiyotaki and John Moore quoted at the beginning of the chapter”


“Money is not principally a means of buying ‘stuff’ but a way of coping with an uncertain future. We do not know which new goods and services will exist in future, nor what their relative prices will be.”


“But our demand for a growing variety of goods and services outstripped the supply available in a given, small locality long ago. A glance at the Amazon website suggests that we want everything, and we want it now”



“But the alchemy of money creation fosters the illusion of unbounded pleasure and the temptation to issue so much money in good times that the result is not prosperity but rising inflation, leading to economic chaos and the destruction of prosperity. Few countries suffered more from this pact with the devil than Goethe’s own homeland in the hyperinflation of 1923.”



“Why have governments allowed money – a public good – to fall under private control? To answer that, we need to understand the role of banks.”

## Chapter 3 



“Many would argue that ‘inconceivable stupidity’ was also the cause of the recent financial crisis – bankers were wicked and central bankers incompetent” “No doubt there were bankers who were indeed wicked and central bankers who were incompetent, though the vast majority of both whom I met during the crisis were neither”



“Banks, too, faced a prisoner’s dilemma. If, before the crisis, they had exited the riskier types of lending, stopped buying complex derivative instruments and reduced their leverage, they would, in the short term, have earned lower profits than their competitors. The chief executive would likely have lost his job, and other staff defected to banks willing to take risks and pay higher bonuses, well before the wisdom of the new strategy had become evident. Even understanding the risks, it was safer to follow the crowd”



“Chuck Prince, the CEO of Citigroup (at the time the biggest bank in the world), who said before the crisis, ‘As long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.’2 He kept on dancing until the music did eventually stop in November 2007, and at that point he lost his job”



“The collapse of the banking system in the United States in the 1930s was so severe that President Franklin Roosevelt, only a week after his inauguration in March 1933, announced a bank holiday (which lasted a week), shutting the banks to provide a breathing space during which confidence could be restored”


“As Macheath pointed out in Brecht’s Threepenny Opera, why rob a bank and risk imprisonment when you could start a bank and create money?”


“would be unrecognisable to him. J.P. Morgan today accounts for almost the same proportion of US banking as all of the top ten banks put together in 1960.10”



“The size of the US banking industry measured in terms of total assets has grown from around 20 per cent of annual GDP one hundred years ago to around 100 per cent today.” 
“In the UK, a medium-sized economy with a large international banking centre, the expansion is even more marked, from around 50 per cent of GDP to over 500 per cent.”
“Today, the assets of the top ten banks in the US amount to over 60 per cent of GDP, six times larger than the top ten fifty years ago.”
NOTE: What about tech companies?

“Because of its critical role in the infrastructure of the economy, markets correctly believed that no government could let a bank fail, since that would cause immense disruption to everyone’s ability to make and receive payments. Creditors were willing to lend to banks at lower interest rates than would otherwise have been on offer because they were confident – correctly as it turned out – that even if things went wrong taxpayers would see them right.”



“In less than fifty years, the share of highly liquid assets held by UK banks declined from around a third of their assets to less than 2 per cent.15 In the US the share had fallen to below 1 per cent just before the crisis.”



“Size became an objective because a bank that was clearly too important and too big to fail was able to borrow more cheaply, and even a small advantage in funding costs meant that it could offer cheaper loans to its customers.”


“Before the crisis, banks paid large salaries and bonuses to people who created and analysed new products that could be sold to their clients. But not enough resources were devoted to assessing the riskiness of the balance sheet as a whole. With a growing proportion of bank activity deriving from the trading of complex instruments, it was difficult to work out how big the risks actually were.”



“By 2015, the total fines imposed on banks worldwide since the banking crisis ended in 2009 amounted to around $300 billion – a staggering figure.19”


“Banks and other financial intermediaries create wealth by providing valuable services to their customers. But there is always the risk that they create the illusion of wealth – in the extreme case of the fraudster Bernie Madoff and his funds there was quite a long period when the perception of wealth was substantially higher than the reality.”



“What is a bank? The answer may seem obvious. It was actor and comedian Bob Hope who said that a bank is ‘a place that will lend you money if you can prove that you don’t need it’.”



“Equity, bond and bank finance are the essential building blocks of the methods companies use to finance themselves – although they can be combined in complex ways”



“Someone who invested $1000 in Berkshire Hathaway in 1985 would by the middle of 2015 have an investment worth $161,000, a compound annual rate of return of almost 17 per cent”



“Consider a simplified version of the balance sheet of Bank of America at the end of 2014. Its assets comprised $139 billion of cash (including reserves held at the Federal Reserve), $867 billion of loans to businesses and households, and $1099 billion of financial investments, together with the value of buildings and other real assets. Total assets were $2105 billion.26 Liabilities comprised $1119 billion of deposits, $743 billion in other forms of borrowing and $243 billion of shareholders’ equity capital, giving total liabilities of $2105 billion. In fact, shareholders’ equity is simply what is left after all other liabilities have been deducted from the value of total assets.
Two features of the balance sheet are striking. First, loans comprise only around 40 per cent of the bank’s assets. Second, although deposits clearly exceed loans, other types of borrowing provide a significant source of finance. There is clearly more to Bank of America than taking in deposits from households and businesses and making loans.”



“What is it that makes banks special? The distinguishing feature of a bank is that its assets are mostly long-term, illiquid and risky, whereas its liabilities are short-term, liquid and perceived as safe.”



“The transformation of short-term liabilities into long-term assets – borrowing short to lend long – is known as maturity transformation.”


“The transmutation of bank deposits – money – with a safe value into illiquid risky investments is the alchemy of money and banking. Despite innumerable banking crises, belief in the alchemy persists.”



“A bank run is likely either if there is a loss of confidence in the value of the bank’s assets or an unusually high demand for liquidity.”


“Canada has a small number of banks (now five) and is not an international financial centre.”


“many of the examples of high personal remuneration, especially in the form of bonuses, in the financial sector reflect not high productivity but what economists call rent-seeking behaviour. In other words, the remuneration is far higher than is necessary to persuade people to work in the industry”



“Banks had become too big to fail, too big to sail, and too big to jail”
