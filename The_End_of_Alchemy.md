# The End of Alchemy: Money, Banking and the Future of the Global 
<a name="top"></a>

This book written by [Mervin King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mervyn_King,_Baron_King_of_Lothbury), British economist and public servant who served as the Governor of the Bank of England from 2003 to 2013. In his own words it tells you “everything you need to know but were afraid to ask about the causes of the recent crisis. So here goes.”


The book opens with a reference to this fragment from "A Tale of Two Cities" from Charles Dickens.

“It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,
it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness,
it was the epoch of belief,
it was the epoch of incredulity,
it was the season of Light,
it was the season of Darkness,
it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair,
we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way— in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.”

## Introduction 

“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity …’
Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities”


“How did this happen? Was it a failure of individuals, institutions or ideas”


“Since the crisis, many have been tempted to play the game of deciding who was to blame for such a disastrous outcome. But blaming individuals is counterproductive – it leads you to think that if just a few, or indeed many, of those people were punished then we would never experience a crisis again.”


**“is it too late to put the genie back in the bottle? No – it is never too late to ask the right questions”**


“one of the arguments of this book is that economics has encouraged ways of thinking that made crises more probable”



**“Economists have brought the problem upon themselves by pretending that they can forecast. No one can easily predict an unknowable future, and economists are no exception.”**


“A theory adequate for today requires us to think for ourselves, standing on the shoulders of giants of the past, not kneeling in front of them.”



“God may have created the universe, but we mortals created paper money and risky banks. They are man-made institutions, important sources of innovation, prosperity and material progress, but also of greed, corruption and crises. For better or worse, they materially affect human welfare.”



“money and banking have been seen as the magical elements that liberated us from a stagnant feudal system and permitted the emergence of dynamic markets capable of making the long-term investments necessary to support a growing economy.”



“banks could take secure short-term deposits and transform them into long-term risky investments, came into its own with the Industrial Revolution in the eighteenth century. It was both revolutionary and immensely seductive. It was in fact financial alchemy – the creation of extraordinary financial powers that defy reality and common sense.”



📝 *__Concept Alert!__*
“slow growth and rising unemployment – the combination known as ‘[stagflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation)”



“Is there a fundamental weakness in the intellectual economic framework underpinning contemporary thinking? Of course, economists use mathematical and statistical methods to understand a complex world – they would be remiss if they did not. Economics is an intellectual discipline that requires propositions to be not merely plausible but subject to the rigour of a logical proof.”



“By alchemy I mean the belief that all paper money can be turned into an intrinsically valuable commodity, such as gold, on demand and that money kept in banks can be taken out whenever depositors ask for it.”



“Four concepts are used extensively in the book: disequilibrium, radical uncertainty, the prisoner’s dilemma and trust.”


📝 *__Concept Alert!__*
“Radical uncertainty refers to uncertainty so profound that it is impossible to represent the future in terms of a knowable and exhaustive list of outcomes to which we can attach probabilities”



“Almost all the things that define modern life, and which we now take for granted, such as cars, aeroplanes, computers and antibiotics, were once unimaginable. The essential challenge facing everyone living in a capitalist economy is the inability to conceive of what the future may hold.”



“Trust is the ingredient that makes a market economy work”



“Long ago, Confucius emphasised the crucial role of trust in the authorities: ‘Three things are necessary for government: weapons, food and trust. If a ruler cannot hold on to all three, he should give up weapons first and food next. Trust should be guarded to the end: without trust we cannot stand.’5”



“It seems that our market economy today is not providing an effective link between the present and the future.”



“Crises do not come out of thin air but are the result of the unavoidable mistakes made by people struggling to cope with an unknowable future”



“the Bank of England, the oldest continuously functioning central bank in the world”



“That certainly gave me a chance to see how money could be managed. I learned, and argued publicly, that this is done best not by relying on gifted individuals to weave their magic, but by designing and building institutions that can be run by people who are merely professionally competent.”

## Chapter 1 



“I think that Capitalism, wisely managed, can probably be made more efficient for attaining economic ends than any alternative system yet in sight.’
John Maynard Keynes, The End of Laissez-faire (1926)”



“History is what happened before you were born. That is why it is so hard to learn lessons from history: the mistakes were made by the previous generation.”



“A younger generation, in academia and government, trained in modern economics, would ensure that the Great Depression of the 1930s would never be repeated.”



“The financial crisis of 2007–9 (hereafter ‘the crisis’) was not the fault of particular individuals or economic policies. Rather, it was merely the latest manifestation of our collective failure to manage the relationship between finance – the structure of money and banking – and a capitalist system”



“Over many years, a capitalist economy has proved the most successful route to escape poverty and achieve prosperity”


Capitalism Definition:
“is an economic system in which private owners of capital hire wage-earners to work in their businesses and pay for investment by raising finance from banks and financial markets”


The Good, the Bad and the Ugly

“Good was a period between about 1990 and 2007 of unprecedented stability of both output and inflation”
“The Bad was the rise in debt levels”
“Between 1986 and 2006, household debt rose from just under 70 per cent of total household income to almost 120 per cent in the United States and from 90 per cent to around 140 per cent in the United Kingdom.9”
“The Ugly was the development of an extremely fragile banking system.”
“Trading of new and highly complex financial products among banks meant that they became so closely interconnected that a problem in one would spread rapidly to others, magnifying rather than spreading risk”
“Banks relied less and less on their own resources to finance lending and became more and more dependent on borrowing”


**NOTE:**
“With a leverage ratio of even 25 it would take a fall of only 4 per cent in the average value of a bank’s assets to wipe out the whole of the shareholders’ equity and leave it unable to service its debts.”

Why?



“In China alone, over 70 million manufacturing jobs were created during the twenty-first century, far exceeding the 42 million working in manufacturing in 2012 in the United States and Europe combined.17”


“Its share in world exports rose from 2 per cent to 12 per cent between 1990 and 2013.18 China and other Asian economies ran large trade surpluses. In other words, they were producing more than they were spending and saving more than they were investing at home.”


“The total assets of US banks, which for a long time had been around one-quarter of annual gross domestic product (GDP, the total value of goods and services produced in the economy), amounted to close to 100 per cent of GDP by the time of the crisis. In Britain, as the main financial centre in Europe, bank assets exceeded 500 per cent of GDP, and they were even larger in Ireland, Switzerland and Iceland.”


“There seemed no limit to China’s willingness to accumulate US dollars. And that has continued unabated – by the end of 2014, China’s foreign exchange reserves exceeded $4 trillion”



“It is always surprising how many bricks can be piled one on top of another without their collapsing. This truth is embodied in the first law of financial crises: an unsustainable position can continue for far longer than you would believe possible.29”


“Attention was focused on risky, irresponsible – and even illegal – mortgage lending in the United States. But the underlying financial problem was the vulnerability of the banking system to US sub-prime mortgages – loans to households on low incomes who were highly likely to default.”


“In 2007 the bank regulators were asked whether the US sub-prime mortgage market was sufficiently large to bring down major banks. The answer was an emphatic no. Although the stock of such mortgages was around $1 trillion, potential losses were not large enough to create a problem for the system as a whole. After all, the loss of wealth in the dotcom crash earlier in the decade had been eight times greater.”


**The Crisis**

“15 September the long-established investment bank Lehman Brothers failed –”


“Banks around the world found it impossible to finance themselves because no one knew which banks were safe and which weren’t. It was the biggest global financial crisis in history.”


“In early October 2008, two UK banks – Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBoS) – found themselves unable to get to the end of the day. The Bank of England lent £60 billion to the two banks to avoid a collapse of the banking system.31”



“The Great Panic lasted less than a month from the failure of Lehman Brothers to the announcement of the recapitalisation of the banks – twenty-eight days that shook the world”



“When the western banking system teetered on the verge of collapse, only drastic intervention, including partial nationalisation, saved it from going over the edge. The potential catastrophe of a collapse finally provoked action to recapitalise the banking system, using public money if necessary; the UK was first to respond, followed by the United States and then continental Europe. That action ended the bank run. The problem was that governments ended up guaranteeing all private creditors of the banks, imposing on future taxpayers a burden of unknown magnitude.”



“The alchemy of our present system of money and banking continues. The strange thing is that after arguably the biggest financial crisis in history, nothing much has really changed in terms either of the fundamental structure of banking or the reliance on central banks to restore macroeconomic prosperity.”



“Interest rates today are too high to permit rapid growth of demand in the short run, but too low to be consistent with a proper balance between spending and saving in the long run.”


“Money and banking proved to be not a form of alchemy, but the Achilles heel of capitalism – a point of weakness that threatens havoc on a scale that drains the life out of a capitalist economy”

## Chapter 2 


“The love of money is the root of all evil.’
1 Timothy, 6:10 (King James Bible)
‘Evil is the root of all money.’
Kiyotaki and Moore (2002)”



“In the United States I studied at Harvard as a Kennedy Scholar.1 Later in life, I was a member of the interviewing panel to select new scholars. One young man, who was studying theology at Oxford, entered the room and, obviously a little nervous, sat on the chair in front of a line of eminent figures. The chairman, a distinguished philosopher, started by asking, ‘Tell me, does God have much of a role in theology these days?’ The young man blinked and never recovered. But it made me think that the question one should ask of economists is, ‘Does money have much of a role in economics these days?”



“After the Normans conquered Britain in 1066, they put together an inventory of wealth – houses, cattle and agricultural land – in order to assess the taxable capacity of their new domain. Known as the Domesday Book, the survey (now available online) measured wealth in terms of pounds, shillings and pence, Anglo-Saxon monetary units still in use in my youth before the decimalisation of Britain’s currency in 1971”


“The earliest banknotes appeared in China in the seventh century AD. Later banknotes from the Ming dynasty in China were made from the bark of mulberry trees – the paper is still soft to the touch today.11 The penalty for counterfeiting was death – as advertised on the notes themselves.12”



“the paradox of money is that people choose to own something that has no intrinsic value, and pays no interest”



“Over time people chose to hold less of it, and money today largely comprises bank deposits rather than notes and coin. How did the liabilities of banks come to be used as money? To explain this we need an alternative history of money, one that focuses on the role of money as a store of value.”
“From this practice emerged the system of banking we see today – illiquid assets financed by liquid deposits or banknotes.”



“The problem with private banks’ creation of money is obvious. Money in the form of private banknotes and deposits is a claim on illiquid assets with an uncertain value. So both its acceptability and stability can from time to time come under threat.”



“After the Great Depression, the introduction of deposit insurance, with the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in 1933, largely eliminated the risk to ordinary depositors. By transferring the risks to the taxpayer, deposit insurance reduced the likelihood of depositors running on their banks, but it cemented the role of banks as the main creators of money in the form of bank deposits with banknotes issued solely by government.”


“Over the past century, the amount of money in the US economy – defined broadly – has remained roughly stable as a proportion of GDP, at around two-thirds, and the share of bank deposits in total money has also been roughly constant at around 90 per cent.” “Gold and silver, which a hundred years ago amounted to around 10 per cent of total money and were of equal importance to notes and coin, are no longer counted as money.”


“Credit booms are less the result of irresponsible lending by banks and more the outcome of optimism on the part of borrowers, aided and abetted by low interest rates and competition between banks to meet customers’ demands.23”


“But the amount of money created by a private banking system may not always correspond to the amount that is socially desirable. Indeed, where the former exceeds the latter there is a risk of financial excess and inflation, and where the former falls short of the latter there is a risk of a financial crisis. Should money be created privately or publicly? The answer depends on how the choice affects the twin criteria of acceptability and stability.”



**Hypterinflation**
“hyperinflation’ – which is usually defined as a period in which the monthly rate of inflation goes above 50 per cent. That may not sound so bad, but it is equivalent to an annual rate of inflation of well over 1000 per cent” “Perhaps the simplest definition of a hyperinflation is when it becomes impossible to keep track of the inflation rate” “It is easier to measure such hyperinflations by the length of time it takes for prices to double”



**Gold**

“For most of the nineteenth century, and right up until the early 1930s, the price of gold was fixed at $20.65 per ounce.35 The Great Depression saw a revaluation of gold to around $35 an ounce, where it stayed until 1971, when the United States abandoned the policy of a fixed dollar price of gold”

“The price of gold is not only volatile but highly sensitive to changes in sentiment about the ability of governments to control their monetary system.”

“Arguably the largest hole in the ground anywhere in the world is the Super Pit at Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. After around fifteen years, the diggers in Kalgoorlie have created a hole that is 4.5 kilometres in length, 1.2 kilometres wide and 500 metres deep. Excavating this hole has yielded 27 million cubic metres of earth which, after processing with acid, has yielded just 10 cubic metres of gold.37”


“For centuries gold has been the most widely accepted form of payment. It is independent of government, and, ironically, governments themselves want to hold reserves in gold because they do not trust other countries to maintain the real value of claims denominated in their own paper currency”


“By far the largest holders of gold are the United States (over 8000 tonnes, comprising 72 per cent of its total reserves of gold and foreign exchange) and the euro area (10,784 tonnes, accounting for 57 per cent of total reserves). China’s holdings have been rising and are now over 1000 tonnes. By contrast, the United Kingdom has only 310 tonnes (11.6 per cent of total reserves) and Japan 765 tonnes (2.5 per cent of total reserves).43”




“If one is very clever, it is indeed possible to talk about monetary policy without using the word ‘money’. The interesting question is why anyone would want to”


“More generally, our inability to make credible pre-commitments, or to trust each other, explains why ‘evil is the root of all money’, to use the phrase coined by the economists Nobuhiro Kiyotaki and John Moore quoted at the beginning of the chapter”


“Money is not principally a means of buying ‘stuff’ but a way of coping with an uncertain future. We do not know which new goods and services will exist in future, nor what their relative prices will be.”


“But our demand for a growing variety of goods and services outstripped the supply available in a given, small locality long ago. A glance at the Amazon website suggests that we want everything, and we want it now”



“But the alchemy of money creation fosters the illusion of unbounded pleasure and the temptation to issue so much money in good times that the result is not prosperity but rising inflation, leading to economic chaos and the destruction of prosperity. Few countries suffered more from this pact with the devil than Goethe’s own homeland in the hyperinflation of 1923.”



“Why have governments allowed money – a public good – to fall under private control? To answer that, we need to understand the role of banks.”

## Chapter 3 



“Many would argue that ‘inconceivable stupidity’ was also the cause of the recent financial crisis – bankers were wicked and central bankers incompetent” “No doubt there were bankers who were indeed wicked and central bankers who were incompetent, though the vast majority of both whom I met during the crisis were neither”



“Banks, too, faced a prisoner’s dilemma. If, before the crisis, they had exited the riskier types of lending, stopped buying complex derivative instruments and reduced their leverage, they would, in the short term, have earned lower profits than their competitors. The chief executive would likely have lost his job, and other staff defected to banks willing to take risks and pay higher bonuses, well before the wisdom of the new strategy had become evident. Even understanding the risks, it was safer to follow the crowd”



“Chuck Prince, the CEO of Citigroup (at the time the biggest bank in the world), who said before the crisis, ‘As long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.’2 He kept on dancing until the music did eventually stop in November 2007, and at that point he lost his job”



“The collapse of the banking system in the United States in the 1930s was so severe that President Franklin Roosevelt, only a week after his inauguration in March 1933, announced a bank holiday (which lasted a week), shutting the banks to provide a breathing space during which confidence could be restored”


“As Macheath pointed out in Brecht’s Threepenny Opera, why rob a bank and risk imprisonment when you could start a bank and create money?”


“would be unrecognisable to him. J.P. Morgan today accounts for almost the same proportion of US banking as all of the top ten banks put together in 1960.10”



“The size of the US banking industry measured in terms of total assets has grown from around 20 per cent of annual GDP one hundred years ago to around 100 per cent today.” 
“In the UK, a medium-sized economy with a large international banking centre, the expansion is even more marked, from around 50 per cent of GDP to over 500 per cent.”
“Today, the assets of the top ten banks in the US amount to over 60 per cent of GDP, six times larger than the top ten fifty years ago.”
NOTE: What about tech companies?

“Because of its critical role in the infrastructure of the economy, markets correctly believed that no government could let a bank fail, since that would cause immense disruption to everyone’s ability to make and receive payments. Creditors were willing to lend to banks at lower interest rates than would otherwise have been on offer because they were confident – correctly as it turned out – that even if things went wrong taxpayers would see them right.”



“In less than fifty years, the share of highly liquid assets held by UK banks declined from around a third of their assets to less than 2 per cent.15 In the US the share had fallen to below 1 per cent just before the crisis.”



“Size became an objective because a bank that was clearly too important and too big to fail was able to borrow more cheaply, and even a small advantage in funding costs meant that it could offer cheaper loans to its customers.”


“Before the crisis, banks paid large salaries and bonuses to people who created and analysed new products that could be sold to their clients. But not enough resources were devoted to assessing the riskiness of the balance sheet as a whole. With a growing proportion of bank activity deriving from the trading of complex instruments, it was difficult to work out how big the risks actually were.”



“By 2015, the total fines imposed on banks worldwide since the banking crisis ended in 2009 amounted to around $300 billion – a staggering figure.19”


“Banks and other financial intermediaries create wealth by providing valuable services to their customers. But there is always the risk that they create the illusion of wealth – in the extreme case of the fraudster Bernie Madoff and his funds there was quite a long period when the perception of wealth was substantially higher than the reality.”



“What is a bank? The answer may seem obvious. It was actor and comedian Bob Hope who said that a bank is ‘a place that will lend you money if you can prove that you don’t need it’.”



“Equity, bond and bank finance are the essential building blocks of the methods companies use to finance themselves – although they can be combined in complex ways”



“Someone who invested $1000 in Berkshire Hathaway in 1985 would by the middle of 2015 have an investment worth $161,000, a compound annual rate of return of almost 17 per cent”



“Consider a simplified version of the balance sheet of Bank of America at the end of 2014. Its assets comprised $139 billion of cash (including reserves held at the Federal Reserve), $867 billion of loans to businesses and households, and $1099 billion of financial investments, together with the value of buildings and other real assets. Total assets were $2105 billion.26 Liabilities comprised $1119 billion of deposits, $743 billion in other forms of borrowing and $243 billion of shareholders’ equity capital, giving total liabilities of $2105 billion. In fact, shareholders’ equity is simply what is left after all other liabilities have been deducted from the value of total assets.
Two features of the balance sheet are striking. First, loans comprise only around 40 per cent of the bank’s assets. Second, although deposits clearly exceed loans, other types of borrowing provide a significant source of finance. There is clearly more to Bank of America than taking in deposits from households and businesses and making loans.”



“What is it that makes banks special? The distinguishing feature of a bank is that its assets are mostly long-term, illiquid and risky, whereas its liabilities are short-term, liquid and perceived as safe.”



“The transformation of short-term liabilities into long-term assets – borrowing short to lend long – is known as maturity transformation.”


“The transmutation of bank deposits – money – with a safe value into illiquid risky investments is the alchemy of money and banking. Despite innumerable banking crises, belief in the alchemy persists.”



“A bank run is likely either if there is a loss of confidence in the value of the bank’s assets or an unusually high demand for liquidity.”


“Canada has a small number of banks (now five) and is not an international financial centre.”


“many of the examples of high personal remuneration, especially in the form of bonuses, in the financial sector reflect not high productivity but what economists call rent-seeking behaviour. In other words, the remuneration is far higher than is necessary to persuade people to work in the industry”



“Banks had become too big to fail, too big to sail, and too big to jail”

## Chapter 4 


“And what you do not know is the only thing you know
And what you own is what you do not own
And where you are is where you are not.
T.S. Eliot, ‘East Coker’, The Four Quartets
‘You’ve got to expect the unexpected.’
Paul Lambert, Aston Villa manager, press conference, 22 November 2013”




“Are we really capable of expecting the unexpected?”

**LTC Failure**

“The return on each transaction was tiny but done on a sufficiently large scale, it generated huge profits.
The choice of assets was based on sophisticated statistical analysis of high-frequency data over a decade or more. 
But the data, although voluminous, covered only a short period of history, and when a rare but significant event – the Russian default and devaluation in the summer of 1998 – occurred, past correlations proved a poor guide to asset returns. LTCM failed.”
“The lesson is that no amount of sophisticated statistical analysis is a match for the historical experience that ‘stuff happens’.”



“At the heart of **modern macroeconomics** is the same illusion that uncertainty can be confined to the mathematical manipulation of known probabilities.”


“Risk, luck, fate, uncertainty, probability theory – we all have names for the game of chance.”


“Most decisions in life involve risk. Sometimes we embrace it, as when we enjoy a bet on the Grand National or the Super Bowl, and sometimes we avoid it, as when we insure our houses against fire. The playing of the hand we are dealt can be a pleasure in a game of bridge and a burden in life”



“Down the ages, quack doctors selling patent medicines and astrologers selling predictions have been in strong demand. Added to their number today are economists selling forecasts, reflecting a desire for certainty that is as irrational as it is understandable.”


“At the start of the crisis in August 2007, the Chief Financial Officer of Goldman Sachs, David Viniar, said that the losses suffered on one of their hedge funds implied that ‘we were seeing things that were 25-standard deviation moves, several days in a row’.3 That certainly is extreme, since such moves should occur even less often than once every 13 billion years, or the time elapsed since the creation of the universe!”



“The difficulty we have in confronting uncertainty, and our strong desire to control our own lives, lead to seemingly irrational decisions. After the terrorist attacks on New York on 11 September 2001, many Americans stopped flying for a period and drove instead. Traffic on interstate highways rose 5 per cent in the three months after the attack, and it took a year before normal patterns of travel were resumed. In that period, around 1600 Americans lost their lives in road accidents because of the switch from flying to driving, some 50 per cent of the death toll incurred on 9/11 itself.6”


“Select around six thousand names and addresses from the London or New York telephone directory. Divide the names into two groups. To the first group, send a letter predicting that the market will rise over the coming week. To the second, write predicting a fall in the market. At the end of the week keep the three thousand or so names who were given the correct prediction and discard the others. Divide those names in turn into two groups. To the first, predict a rise in the market and to the second, a fall. Repeat this process for five weeks, at which point there will be around 200 people to whom the following letter could be sent: ‘You may well have been sceptical when you received our first letter, but by now you will know that we have indeed found the secret of predicting successfully the direction of movement of the stock market. You know that our method really works. To subscribe to our investment service please send £5000 by return.”



“Coping with uncertainty is by no means straightforward, even for the most highly trained professionals. As Voltaire put it, ‘Doubt is not a pleasant condition, but certainty is an absurd one.'”


“In this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes,’ wrote Benjamin Franklin in 1789”


“In 1798, life expectancy in Britain was around forty. Today it is over eighty, and even higher for women. We simply do not know how life expectancy will change in the future.11 Developments in medical science, especially the results of stem-cell research, may enhance the prospects for life expectancy radically, and new infectious diseases may have the opposite effect.”



“Good judgement rather than statistical extrapolation is key to making assessments about changes not only in longevity but in many economic and social variables”

Note: What about modern statistical models with understanding and quantification of the assumtptions.




“Neither producers nor consumers can know what options will be available to them in the future, and so they cannot express preferences in markets that might provide a guide to investment decisions. The markets are simply missing. And how tedious it would be if we could imagine what the future holds. Uncertainty – radical uncertainty – is the spice of life.”




“The main defence of the theory of optimising behaviour is the one provided by Milton Friedman in 1953, when he compared people making economic decisions with billiards or snooker players who do not understand Newtonian mechanics, but play as if they did.15”




“But we know that when computers play chess, they do so differently from human beings. The former make millions of calculations; the latter make intuitive leaps of imagination.”




“Human capacity for making conscious calculations is bounded, but the ability of the human brain to engage in lateral thinking is well developed. People are better than computers at recognising faces.”




“The language of optimisation is seductive. But humans do not optimise; they cope. They respond and adapt to new surroundings, new stimuli and new challenges. The concept of coping behaviour does not, however, mean that people are irrational. On the contrary, coping is an entirely rational response to the recognition that the world is uncertain.”




“The strength of economics as a social science is the belief that people will attempt to behave rationally. The challenge is to work out how a rational person might cope with radical uncertainty. People aren’t dumb. It is just that in a world of radical uncertainty even smart people do not find it easy to know what it means to behave in a smart manner.”




“behavioural economics’, a relatively new field often associated with Daniel Kahneman, Richard Thaler and Amos Tversky. It studies the emotional and psychological dimensions of economic choices.”



“The stock market is a good example of the tendency of economists ‘to excel in hindsight (fitting) but fail in foresight (prediction)’.23”



“Tuckett sees them as engaging in a continuous two-way communication. As he argues, ‘emotion exists to help economic human actors when reason alone is insufficient’.24 In other words, emotions help us to cope with an unknowable future and should not be seen as ‘irrational’.”



“Once we are liberated from the view that there is a single optimising solution, rules of thumb – technically known as heuristics – are better seen as rational ways to cope with an unknowable future. A heuristic is a decision rule that deliberately ignores information. It does so not just because humans are not computers, but because it is rational to ignore information when we do not understand how the world works”



“Humans are not pre-programmed to solve complex mathematical optimising problems, because it is impossible to know in advance which problems they will need to solve. But they are programmed to learn and to adapt”




“A coping strategy comprises three elements – a categorisation of problems into those that are amenable to optimising behaviour and those that are not; a set of rules of thumb, or heuristics, to cope with the latter class of problems; and a narrative.”




“When we cannot write down a mathematical model with numerical probabilities, we can nevertheless think and talk about the future in qualitative terms.”




“The first concerns J.P. Morgan and its British-born banker Sir Dennis Weatherstone, who started as a bookkeeper at the age of sixteen and rose to become CEO in 1990. The challenge was how to decide which of the many new and obscure financial products suggested by the traders and mathematicians on its staff the firm should sell to its clients. With no past history for the performance of those products, there was no basis for judging which ones were likely to be effective. The new products were an example of radical uncertainty. The strategy Weatherstone employed was to make sure that any new product was understood by senior management. The narrative underlying the strategy was that if the product could be explained in a conversation among senior managers then there was less risk that something might go badly wrong. Weatherstone, I was told, would give the inventors three slots of fifteen minutes to explain the product to him. If at the end of that he still did not understand the product, the firm would not sell it.28 In 2008 there must have been many executives who wished they had followed Weatherstone’s heuristic.”




“A useful heuristic for managers and regulators alike is to probe not only those parts of a business that are losing a lot of money but also those that are making a lot.”



“are assumed not to default on their debt – an assumption that might have looked reasonable when the standards were drawn up after long negotiations among many countries, but looked decidedly odd during the euro area crisis from 2012 onwards”



“Risk-weighted capital requirements appealed to many of my international colleagues because risk was explicitly incorporated into the calculation. But if the nature of the uncertainty is unknown, then the use of such measures can be highly misleading. It is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong, and to use a simple but more robust measure of required capital.”



“Heuristics are better than so-called optimising solutions that assume the wrong model. In the case of bank regulation, it is better to use a measure of leverage rather than a ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets. Leverage ratios measure capital relative to total (unweighted) assets.”




“What is the purpose of all these financial markets? They channel household savings into business investment, at home and abroad. They make it possible to share risk by giving us the opportunity to insure, hedge, or even speculate, against future events. And they provide continuous valuations – a financial running commentary – of the myriad activities that make up our economy.”




“Derivatives typically involve little up-front payment and are a contract between two parties to exchange a flow of returns or commodities in the future. The principle of derivative instruments is simple, but if you want to make it complicated there are many lawyers, and investment bankers who will help you – at a (significant) price.”




“It is rather like watching two old men playing chess in the sun for a bet of $10, as one can in Washington Square in New York, and then realising that they are watched by a crowd of bankers who are taking bets on the result to the tune of millions of dollars. The scope for introducing risk into the system rather than sharing it around is obvious. And that is why Warren Buffett described derivatives as ‘financial weapons of mass destruction’.34”




“By adopting the modern accounting convention of valuing the new instruments by ‘marking to market’ – that is, valuing assets at the latest observed price and including all changes in asset values as profits – optimism about the future, whether justified or not, created large recorded profits from the trading of these new securities”




“Indeed, once markets realised that different banks had different risks of failure then the whole concept of a single interbank borrowing rate became meaningless. Does this matter? Yes – because LIBOR is used as a reference rate in drawing up derivative contracts worth trillions of dollars. The benchmark interest rate used in those contracts had shallow foundations and in a storm it just blew down.”




“But at times in 2007–8 there were so few transactions in the interbank market that any quote submitted would have been hypothetical. An understandable response by some banks was to withdraw from the panel to which quotes were reported, only to discover that while being investigated by regulators for the submission of false quotes, they were also being told that they had to keep submitting quotes with no basis in reality. LIBOR has had its day.42”




“The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter coined the phrase ‘creative destruction’ for the way a capitalist economy promotes investment in new ideas and ventures, undermining investments in earlier undertakings.44”




“Keynes’s description of the stock market has become famous:
… professional investment may be likened to those newspaper competitions in which the competitors have to pick out the six prettiest faces from a hundred photographs, the prize being awarded to the competitor whose choice most nearly corresponds to the average preferences of the competitors as a whole; so that each competitor has to pick, not those faces which he himself finds prettiest, but those which he thinks likeliest to catch the fancy of the other competitors, all of whom are looking at the problem from the same point of view. It is not a case of choosing those which, to the best of one’s judgment, are really the prettiest, nor even those which average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest. We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be. And there are some, I believe, who practise the fourth, fifth and higher degrees.45”



“Central to a capitalist economy is the fact that the future cannot be seen as a game of chance in which the only source of uncertainty is on which number the wheel of fortune will come to rest. The future is simply unknowable. And in a capitalist economy, money, banking and financial markets are institutions that have evolved to provide a way of coping with an unpredictable future. They are the real-world substitute for the economic theorist’s concept of a grand auction.”



“Money is not just a means of buying ‘stuff’ but a way of dealing with an uncertain future. A rise in the desire for a reserve of generalised future purchasing power lowers spending today, and can lead to a recession or even a depression.”

## Chapter 5


20 January 2021 (page page_156)

“There have been three great inventions since the beginning of time: fire, the wheel, and central banking.’
Will Rogers, American actor and social commentator, 1920
‘I promise on demand to pay,’ affords,
A sort of fascinating sounding words;
And if I’m not the most deceiv’d on earth,
The sound they make is nearly all they’re worth.
Anonymous, The Siege of Paternoster Row, 1826”


21 January 2021 (page page_158)

“In his bestseller The Lords of Finance, Liaquat Ahmed describes the four shadowy central bank governors who led the world into, and eventually out of, the Great Depression. Eighty years later, the equivalent group of governors, of which I was one, confronted an equally difficult challenge. But the difference was that in the build-up to the crisis that started in 2007, central banks had come out of the shadows into the sunlight. They were embarking on a journey from mystery and mystique to transparency and openness”


21 January 2021 (page page_158)

“Money and banking may seem boring technical topics. But they generate more than enough excitement when things go wrong.”


21 January 2021 (page page_159)

“The first central bank was the Riksbank in Sweden, set up in 1668. To celebrate its tercentenary it endowed the Nobel Prize in Economic Science. But the Riksbank did not acquire its name until 1867 and was really only a commercial bank until 1897.3”


21 January 2021 (page page_159)

“The oldest central bank in continuous existence, the Bank of England, opened for business in 1694 to help the government finance military expenditure. Its tercentenary was a more low-key event: it held a concert and published a book of conference proceedings”


21 January 2021 (page page_159)

“The United States had two false starts in central banking – with the First Bank of the United States between 1791 and 1811 and the Second Bank of the United States between 1816 and 1836 – before Congress legislated in 1913 to set up the Federal Reserve, which opened for business in 1914.4”


21 January 2021 (page page_159)

“Before recommending the establishment of the Federal Reserve System – a plan which it described as ‘essentially an American system, scientific in its methods, and democratic in its control’ – the Commission produced twenty-two volumes on monetary and banking systems elsewhere, especially in Europe. A complete set sits proudly in the Governor’s anteroom in the Bank of England. The authors noted that ‘the important place which the Bank of England holds in the financial world is due to the wisdom of the men who have controlled its operations and not to any legislative enactments”


23 January 2021 (page page_161)

“After the experience of banking crises in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Congress was persuaded that a central bank was both constitutional and a good idea.”


23 January 2021 (page page_163)

“Experience has demonstrated the importance of a public body – normally the central bank – responsible for two key aspects of the management of money in a capitalist economy. The first is to ensure that in good times the amount of money grows at a rate sufficient to maintain broad stability of the value of money, and the second is to ensure that in bad times the amount of money grows at a rate sufficient to provide the liquidity – a reserve of future purchasing power – required to meet unpredictable swings in the demand for it by the private sector”


23 January 2021 (page page_163)

“Those two functions are rather simple to state, if hard to carry out. They correspond to the twin objectives of price stability and the provision of liquidity by a ‘lender of last resort’.”


23 January 2021 (page page_163)

“Lenin is alleged to have remarked that the best way to destroy capitalism is to debauch the currency. To judge by the subsequent experience in Europe after the First World War, he was right.”


23 January 2021 (page page_164)

“In the twenty-five years before the Bank of England adopted an inflation target in 1992, prices rose by over 750 per cent, more than over the previous two hundred and fifty years.12 Inflation was simply taken for granted. Price stability seemed an unlikely state of affairs.”


23 January 2021 (page page_164)

“Alan Blinder, the Princeton economist who was Greenspan’s deputy at the Federal Reserve Board, put it even more clearly. Price stability, he said, was ‘when ordinary people stop talking and worrying about inflation’.14”


23 January 2021 (page page_167)

“Our inability to identify in advance the challenges that will arise in managing money means that it is sensible, indeed unavoidable, to grant the central bank a degree of discretion in responding to unfolding events. This is the basic idea behind inflation targeting, which originated in New Zealand in 1990. The idea soon spread to Canada in 1991 and the United Kingdom in 1992. The aim was to hold the central bank to account for achieving a numerical target for inflation over a specified period”


23 January 2021 (page page_168)

“The overriding concern of central banks is not to eliminate fluctuations in consumer price inflation from year to year, but to reduce the degree of uncertainty over the price level in the long run. People will then stop worrying about inflation.”


23 January 2021 (page page_168)

“An inflation-targeting monetary policy is a combination of two elements: (a) a target for inflation in the medium term and (b) a response to economic shocks in the short term”


24 January 2021 (page page_168)

“Monetary policy rules have become a major area of research.20 Perhaps the most famous is the so-called Taylor rule, named after John Taylor of Stanford University. The Taylor rule implies that interest rates should rise if inflation is above its target and output is above its trend level, and fall when the converse is true”


24 January 2021 (page page_168)

“In 2014, Representatives Scott Garrett and Bill Huizenga introduced a bill that would require the Federal Reserve to provide Congress with ‘a clear rule to describe the course of monetary policy’.21 Such a rule would be a mathematical formula showing how the Fed would adjust interest rates in response to changes in the economy.”


24 January 2021 (page page_169)

“Delegating policy to an independent central bank operating under a well-specified regime of ‘constrained discretion’ was seen as the answer to the unappealing choice between adopting a fixed rule and giving unfettered discretion to an independent body. Such a framework required a clear definition of the constraints to be imposed on central banks. One was a numerical target for inflation, and a second was the establishment of a regime under which central banks could be held accountable for their decisions”
24 January 2021 (page page_170)

“The great attraction of an inflation target is that it is a framework that does not have to be changed each time we learn something new about how the economy behaves.”


24 January 2021 (page page_172)

“those who believe that central banks should focus at least as much on ‘financial stability’ as on ‘price stability’, meaning that monetary policy can and should try to affect much more than just short-run movements in inflation. The difficulty with this proposition is that failure to achieve financial stability covers a multitude of sins. It may reflect the consequence for asset prices of ‘mistakes’ by economic agents – the rapid increases often loosely described as ‘bubbles’. Or it may reflect excessive fragility in the banking sector resulting from excessively high leverage and interconnectedness”


24 January 2021 (page page_173)

“Macro-prudential instruments include direct controls on financial markets – for example, setting limits on the size of mortgage loans relative to incomes – and indirect controls – such as requiring banks to use more equity finance if they increase lending to areas that are judged particularly risky”


25 January 2021 (page page_173)

“Before the crisis, central banks believed that their role was not to enter into the allocation of resources, but rather to guide the economy by sending price signals (in the form of interest rates) about the appropriate relative prices of spending today and in the future. Today, the use of measures to intervene in particular asset markets is all the rage”


25 January 2021 (page page_175)

“During my time at the Bank of England, it became apparent that politicians and central bank governors were on a divergent path. As they try to make an impression on the electorate, politicians have become taller and taller, whereas central bank governors have become shorter and shorter”


25 January 2021 (page page_176)

“This observation leads to what we might call the Maradona theory of interest rates. The great Argentine footballer, Diego Maradona, is not usually associated with the theory of monetary policy. But his performance against England in the World Cup in Mexico City in June 1986 when he scored twice is a perfect illustration of my point. Maradona’s first ‘hand of God’ goal, when he deliberately punched the ball into the England net unseen by the referee, was obviously against the rules. He was lucky to get away with it. His second and quite brilliant goal, however, was an example of the power of expectations. Maradona ran sixty yards from inside his own half, beating five players before shooting into the English goal. The truly remarkable thing, however, is that, as cameras positioned above the stadium showed, Maradona ran virtually in a straight line. How can you beat five players by running in a straight line? The answer is that the English defenders reacted to what they expected Maradona to do. Because they expected Maradona to move either left or right, he was able to go straight on.
Monetary policy works in a similar way. Market interest rates react to[…]”

25 January 2021 (page page_177)

“In recent years there have been periods in which central banks have been able to influence the path of the economy without making large moves in official interest rates. They headed in a straight line for their goals. How was that possible? Because financial markets did not expect interest rates to remain constant. They expected that rates would move either up or down.”


25 January 2021 (page page_177)

“Maradona theory of interest rates in action was seen in the UK in 2002. During that year the Bank of England was able to achieve its inflation target by moving in a straight line with unchanged official interest rates”


25 January 2021 (page page_178)

“It should be clear that, just as Maradona could not hope to score in every game by running towards goal in a straight line, so monetary policy cannot hope to meet the inflation target by leaving official interest rates unchanged indefinitely.”


25 January 2021 (page page_178)

“But the key point is that the power of expectations about future rates can often be more important than the current level of the official interest rate itself.”


25 January 2021 (page page_178)

“The old world was illustrated by Lord Cunliffe, the Governor of the Bank of England during the First World War, who, when giving evidence before a Royal Commission on the size of the Bank of England’s gold and foreign exchange reserves, replied that they were ‘very, very considerable’. When pressed by the commission to give an approximate figure, he replied that he would be ‘very, very reluctant to add to what he had said’. Today the figures are published monthly.”


25 January 2021 (page page_178)

“Until February 1994, believe it or not, the Federal Reserve did not even reveal what the official interest rate was, or whether it had changed. Analysts and researchers had to infer from market interest rates whether or not the Federal Reserve had changed policy. Today, the Federal Reserve publishes the decision of each meeting along with minutes of the discussion and reasons for its actions.”


25 January 2021 (page page_179)

“In any policy setting, there has to be room for private conversations. There are limits to the desirable degree of transparency.”


25 January 2021 (page page_179)

“It is also important for central banks to be honest about what they do not know. A case in point was the recent, and rather short-lived, experiment in ‘forward guidance’ adopted by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in 2013. Both central banks wanted to provide more information about the likely future path of official interest rates. In the first instance, this was a laudable attempt to reduce uncertainty about how they might respond to developments in the economy. But it soon became an attempt to predict the future path of interest rates.”


25 January 2021 (page page_180)

“To retain credibility, it is important that central banks do not claim to know more than they in fact do. And it is clear that central banks are not able to provide accurate forecasts of their own actions. Policy must confront the fact that ‘stuff happens’.”


25 January 2021 (page page_180)

“Making forecasts is inherently difficult. They always turn out to be wrong. The most egregious example of wrong forecasts by central banks was the prediction before the crisis that the Great Stability would continue. Central banks were using forecasting models that ignored the lessons explored in Chapter 4.”


25 January 2021 (page page_180)

“Reducing interest rates stimulates the demand for borrowing and if banks increase their lending, the supply of bank deposits rises. That pushes up the money supply.”


26 January 2021 (page page_181)

“Instabilities in the demand for money are not new. In the early years of the Bank of England, there were unexpected shifts in the demand for money and credit resulting from the uncertain arrival times in the Port of London of ships laden with commodities from all over the world. The uncertainty derived from changes in the direction and speed of the wind carrying ships up the Thames. To cope with this, the Court Room of the Bank of England contained a wind dial linked to a weather vane on the roof, which provided an accurate guide to these shifts in money demand – the weather vane is there to this day, and it still works. If only monetary policy could be as scientific today!”


26 January 2021 (page page_182)

“The method used to create money was to buy government bonds from the private sector in return for money.28 Those bond purchases were described by many commentators as ‘unconventional’ monetary policies and became known as ‘quantitative easing’, or QE”


26 January 2021 (page page_182)

“For open market operations to exchange money for government securities have long been a traditional tool of central banks, and were used regularly in the UK during the 1980s, when they were given the descriptions ‘overfunding’ and ‘underfunding’.29 What was new in the crisis was the sheer scale of the bond purchases – £375 billion by the Bank of England, almost 20 per cent of GDP, and $2.7 trillion by the Federal Reserve, around 15 per cent of GDP.”


26 January 2021 (page page_183)

“Ben Bernanke, then Chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in January 2014 that ‘the problem with QE is it works in practice, but it doesn’t work in theory’.31 Perhaps there was a problem with the theory.”


30 January 2021 (page page_184)

“When the yield curve is completely flat, central banks may still create money by purchasing assets other than government bonds – either private sector assets, such as corporate bonds, or overseas currencies (the latter was the main strategy pursued by the Swiss National Bank in a vain attempt to prevent a sharp appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro)”


26 January 2021 (page page_186)

“Inflation is not a beast that can be killed once and for all. Success is a matter of the patient application of policies designed to maintain price stability. Central bankers are like doctors – they need to be on top of the latest technical developments, have several years of experience and a good bedside manner. Even then, it may be impossible to do much more than avoid big mistakes and promote a healthy way of living. Stability is like dieting – it is no good alternating between binge and starvation, boom and bust. It is necessary to follow a few principles consistently and in a sustained manner. Inflation targeting represented a healthy way of living for central banks charged with the task of ensuring monetary stability.33 Accountability and transparency provide the incentives for central banks to meet the inflation target.”


30 January 2021 (page page_187)

“Over the past 150 years the conventional wisdom has been that central banks should stand ready to be the ‘lender of last resort’ (LOLR) and supply liquidity to the banking system when the public loses confidence in one or more banks.”


30 January 2021 (page page_187)

“It is a little-known, though not uninteresting, fact that the Wimbledon Championships are viewed in more countries than belong to the International Monetary Fund, and they are certainly more entertaining than the Annual Meetings of the IMF.”


30 January 2021 (page page_188)

“Lombard Street. Setting out the doctrine of the LOLR – lend freely against good collateral at a penalty rate to banks facing a run – it became the bible for central bankers wondering how to respond to financial crises. Ben Bernanke at the Federal Reserve, and other central bank governors, often referred to Bagehot when explaining the measures they had taken to support banks during the recent crisis.35”


30 January 2021 (page page_190)

“One of the unique roles of central banks is the ability to create ‘liquidity’.41 Banks create money, but if people lose faith in banks, the ultimate form of money is that created by the central bank – provided it is backed by the tax-raising power of a solvent government.”


30 January 2021 (page page_191)

“The expressions ‘lender of last resort’ and ‘bailout’ have become synonymous. It is only a matter of time before there is a demand for a LOLR for the Bank of Mum and Dad.”


30 January 2021 (page page_192)

“The provision of insurance without a proper charge is an incentive to take excessive risks – in modern jargon, it creates ‘moral hazard”


30 January 2021 (page page_193)

“So what happened in 1914? Historians have long documented the prevailing disbelief in the likelihood of a European war. Among other things, the economic cost would simply be too high.”


30 January 2021 (page page_194)

“Even after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand (heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne) in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914, there was barely a ripple in London markets. It was almost a month before financial markets woke up to the significance of the unfolding political events, and it was the ultimatum from Austria to Serbia (demanding that Serbia take draconian steps to suppress the expression of nationalist opinions) on 23 July that finally changed sentiment.
The next two weeks saw panic in markets and among banks. European stock markets fell sharply, and several were closed. There was a flight to safety, especially to cash, and liquidity dried up in all major markets, including those for foreign exchange, stocks and shares. Three-month interest rates more than doubled. At 10.15 a.m. on Friday 31 July the London Stock Exchange was closed in order to postpone settlement of transactions and thereby prevent a wave of failures among its members as prices plummeted.”


30 January 2021 (page page_194)

“As Keynes later put it, ‘the banks revived for a few days the old state, of which hardly a living Englishman had a memory, in which the man who had £50 in a stocking was better off than the man who had £50 in a bank’.49”


30 January 2021 (page page_195)

“The start of the First World War saw the end of the period during which most countries had fixed the price of their currency in terms of gold (and hence to each other) – the gold standard”


30 January 2021 (page page_196)

“During that earlier crisis, John Pierpoint Morgan had added to his fame by organising a private consortium of banks to lend to banks under suspicion, so averting a major collapse of the banking system, though other banks did suspend payments and there was a sharp contraction of the US economy. From that experience came the impetus to create the Federal Reserve System, which would be able to lend to banks that were temporarily short of funds – to act as a lender of last resort – obviating the need for a Morgan or similar to organise a private consortium to prevent a banking failure.”


31 January 2021 (page page_207)

“Despite some ups and downs, central banks are starting this century well ahead of where they were a century ago. There are more of them, and they have greater power and influence. But has their reputation peaked? Will future historians look back on central banks as a phenomenon largely of the twentieth century? Although central banks have matured, they have not yet reached old age. But their extinction cannot be ruled out altogether. Societies have managed without central banks in the past”


31 January 2021 (page page_207)

“Before the crisis, central banking seemed rather simple. There was a single objective – price stability – and a successful framework within which to make decisions on interest rates – inflation targeting. It seemed a successful coping strategy. Communication became more important, and central banks moved from mystery and mystique to transparency and openness. During the crisis, however, many of those assumptions were challenged, as we learned how inadequate our understanding of the economy and the financial system was. There is more to managing the economy than hitting a target for consumer price inflation. Most of the models used by central banks to forecast the economy proved deficient in explaining the disequilibrium in their own and the world economy, as described in Chapter 1. As a result, policy-makers failed to realise that the period of low inflation and steady growth during the Great Stability was unsustainable, and would probably come to an end with a crash of some sort.”


31 January 2021 (page page_209)

“There is a risk in expecting more from central banks than they can, in fact, deliver. Some people seem to believe that central banks are the answer to all of our economic problems – the ‘only game in town’. Any central bank that allows itself to be described as the ‘only game in town’ would be well advised to get out of town. In the end, expecting too much from central banks will produce disillusionment with the central bank independence that played such an important role in the conquering of inflation. With careful design of the mandate for central banks they can continue to be one of the three great inventions since the beginning of time.”
