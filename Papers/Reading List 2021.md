# Want to Read

List of academic papers that I want to read this year. My intention is to revisit classic papers but also learn about recent developments.


- [Valuing American Options by Simulation](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~hjfurrer/teaching/LongstaffSchwartzAmericanOptionsLeastSquareMonteCarlo.pdf)
- [Neural Networks with Asymptotics Control](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3544698)
